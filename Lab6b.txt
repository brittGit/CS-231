Subroutine: Lab6b
 
Write a program for a grocery store to calculate the total charge for customers.
In the main: 
Your program should ask customer the number of items that he/she is purchasing and it should 
check to see it is less than or equal to 20 items , then your program should pass than number to 
FillPriceArray subroutine and call FillPriceArray subroutine.
FillPriceArray subroutine fills the array, accumulate the prices and return the sum to main.
In the main you get the number of coupons form user (it should be the same as the number of items) 
and pass the coupon number to FillCouponArray sub and call FillCouponArray to fill the CouponArray. 
FillCouponArray sub gets the coupon amount. The coupon should be less than item price and coupon 
should not be more than $10 if the coupon is more than item price or exceed $10 then you place 0 in the 
CouponArray for that coupon.  Also the FillCouponArray sub accumulates the coupons and return it 
to main. Finally your main program should calculate the total charge by subtracting the total price from
total discount coupons and out put the total charge with a thank you massage on the screen.
